## Conclusion

The Procore SDK currently has significant API surface gaps with only 32% overall coverage. A systematic approach to validation and completion is essential for production readiness. The proposed 8-week validation strategy provides a comprehensive framework for achieving 90%+ API surface coverage while ensuring quality, performance, and developer experience standards.

The success of this initiative will be measured not just by coverage percentages, but by the SDK's ability to support real-world construction management workflows effectively and efficiently.
