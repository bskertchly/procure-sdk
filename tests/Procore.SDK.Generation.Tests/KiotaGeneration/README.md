## Integration with Existing Test Infrastructure

This test suite integrates with the existing Procore SDK test infrastructure:

- **Shared Test Dependencies**: Uses the same testing frameworks (xUnit, NSubstitute, FluentAssertions)
- **Common Patterns**: Follows established test patterns from Core and Shared test projects
- **CI/CD Integration**: Runs as part of the standard build and test pipeline
- **Coverage Reporting**: Contributes to overall SDK test coverage metrics

## Future Considerations

### Extensibility
- Test framework can be extended for additional generated clients
- Performance baselines can be adjusted as clients evolve
- Integration tests can be expanded for new authentication methods

### Maintenance
- Tests are designed to be maintainable as OpenAPI specifications evolve
- Configuration tests validate generation consistency across updates
- Performance tests provide regression detection for code generation changes

This comprehensive test strategy ensures that the transition from placeholder implementations to fully functional generated Kiota clients maintains quality, performance, and integration standards while providing confidence in the generated code quality.
